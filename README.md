## rpi3-os

This is a really simple OS for x86-1452. Just kidding! This is a ridiculous OS for Raspberry Pi 3. I've answered some key questions below:

### Does it work?
Maybe!

### What does it do?
I have no idea!

### Why'd you build it?
I wanted to suffer.

### Is there a use for this?
Proba--absolutely not!

### Why're you like this?
I don't know!

Actually though, go check out [bztsrc's tutorial](https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial) if you want a real tutorial. Or [jsandler18's tutorial](https://jsandler18.github.io/)! Or maybe take a look at [this forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=201556), or [this one](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=214367), or even this great [OSDev Wiki page](https://wiki.osdev.org/Raspberry_Pi_Bare_Bones). These are how I got started building this cute OS (that might even boot!), and they've put in great work that you should check out. Also much of their code/tutorials was used as a starting point for this, and I'm eternally grateful they put their work online.
